## Submission Instructions

### Overview

Our project is "Summer Camp Quest" which helps parents/students to explore all
available summer camps options in 'St. Louis' location in one website.
Users can view camps using price, age, category etc. & mark their favorite ones.
Admin users will add / update / delete the camp details.
Why did we get motivated? As parents, we face hard time finding the camps at
one place where we lose track of the camps, and it is a time-consuming process. We
came up with an idea to create a website that would be helpful for parents as well
as high school students.
